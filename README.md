# ZT-DE-week5-miniproject5
This project is represented by a simple Python script that interacts with an SQLite database using SQLite3 library. This library is built into Python, so we you don't need to install it separately. If you have found my requirements.txt blank, no worries! That's the reason that we don't any dependencies!

***When run the Python script, you're going to see some results of operations like insertion, update and delete of the data.
